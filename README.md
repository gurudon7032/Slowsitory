# Resume Builder - Fixed One Page Template (Vite + React + Tailwind)

This project is a one-page resume builder. It includes:
- Live form to edit resume content
- Live print-ready preview (one-page A4)
- Export to PDF using react-to-print (opens print/save dialog)

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open the URL shown by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173)

## Notes

- Node v18+ recommended (you have v22 â€” perfect).
- If `npm run dev` gives plugin errors, delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then run `npm install` again.
- Tailwind is included as a devDependency; if you want JIT features, ensure Tailwind is configured in your environment.
